God makes sense of the origin of the universe

Where the universe came from? Why everything exists instead of just nothing?

Atheists have said that the universe is just eternal, but this is unreasonable. If the universe never had a beginning, that means that the number of past events in the history of the universe is infinite. But the concept of infinity is a purely mathematical one, it is just an idea in your mind, not something that exists in reality.

> The infinite is nowhere to be found in reality. It neither exists in nature nor provides a legitimate basis for rational thought. . . . The role that remains for the infinite to play is solely that of an idea. – David Hilbert
 
Therefore, the series of past events can’t go back forever; rather the universe must have begun to exist and this is confirmed by science, that calls this event "Big Bang". As Cambridge astronomer Fred Hoyle points out, the Big Bang theory requires the creation of the universe from nothing.

But since everything that comes to exist has a cause we must conclude that the universe also has a cause.

And this cause must be an uncaused, changeless, timeless, and immaterial. It must be uncaused because we’ve seen that there cannot be an infinite regress of causes. It must be timeless and therefore changeless because it created time. Because it also created space, it must transcend space as well and therefore be immaterial, not physical.

This cause must also be <i>personal</i>. Any timeless cause without the ability to choose can have only timeless effects. For example, the cause of water’s freezing is the temperature’s being below 0° Centigrade. If the temperature were below 0° from eternity past, then any water that was around would be frozen from eternity. It would be impossible for the water to begin to freeze just a finite time ago. So if the cause is timelessly present, then the effect should be timelessly present as well.
